# HERV annotations

## HML2

Internal: ERVK-int

LTR: LTR5, LTR5A, LTR5B, LTR5_Hs

## HML3

Internal: HERVK9-int

LTR: MER9

## HERVW

Internal: HERV17-int

LTR: LTR17

###### From: RepBase HERV17

LTRs of the class I HERV17 (aka HERV-W) are listed as LTR17 sequences. HERV17 is related
to HERV9/pHE1 and was relatively recently (<20 Mya) active as copies of the younger
subfamilies are < 6% diverged from the consensus (primarily at CpG sites).
ORFs: 1938-3143 (gag), 3670-6912 (pol) and 6940-8568 (env). A copy of the latter has been
exapted as the human syncytin gene (gb|AAF28334.1, see Curr.Opin.Genet.Devel.9 (6),
657-663 (1999) and references therein).

HERV-W is a multicopy human endogenous retrovirus group that consists of about 1300 loci
(including solo LTR, complete and partial loci). In our study, HERV-W loci on chromosomes
6q21 and 7q21.2 were identified as being transcribed at higher levels in MF lesions.

## HERVH

Internal: HERVH-int

LTR: LTR7, LTR7A, LTR7B, LTR7C, LTR7Y

Aliases: RTVL-H2

The long terminal repeat associated with HERVH is LTR7. The putative env gene, consisting of about 1800 base pairs, has
two open reading frames interrupted by a termination codon. The amino acid sequence of this region shows significant
homology to those of other retroviral envelope proteins and contains eight potential glycosylation sites. It is
estimated that there are about 100 copies of RTVL-H elements containing the env gene per haploid human genome. Note that
this estimate is distinct from simply tallying all hits (long and short) from this model.

## HERV9

Internal: HERV9-int

LTR: LTR12, LTR12B, LTR12C, LTR12D, LTR12E, LTR12F, LTR12_

LTRs of HERV9/HERV-pHE1 are listed in REPBASE as LTR12 sequences. Part of the internal sequence is listed as
interspersed repeat PTR5.

## HERV-Fc1

Internal: HERV-Fc1-int

LTR: HERV-Fc1_LTR1, HERV-Fc1_LTR2, HERV-Fc1_LTR3

## HERV-Fc2

Internal: HERV-Fc2-int

LTR: HERV-Fc2_LTR


The HERV-Fc family is closely related to the HERV-H family
